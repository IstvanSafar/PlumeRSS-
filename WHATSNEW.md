# What's New in Plume

**v1.5.1 - 2026-05-12**

---

- **Fixed**: Podcast mini-player controls (play/pause, ±15/30s skip, stop, seek bar) moved from the article reader into `MainActivity` so the player stays visible while navigating — it no longer disappears when the user goes back.
- **Fixed**: "Show all feeds" toggle now persists across app restarts — the setting was being reset to its default every time the app relaunched.
- **Fixed**: CDATA markers (`<![CDATA[...]]>`) no longer appear in article or feed titles fetched from Feedly, TheOldReader, or local RSS feeds.
- **Improved**: RSS/Podcast Discover — country selector now includes 22 languages (up from 7; added IT, PL, NL, PT, RO, CZ, SK, SE, DK, FI, NO, RU, UA, CN, BR). Category searches are now biased toward the selected language by appending a language keyword to the Feedly query. Changing the country while a custom search is active keeps the typed query; switching while the category view is shown reloads with localised terms.
- **Improved**: Floating read all button

---

**v1.5.0 - 2026-05-10**

---

- **Fixed**: Version update check now correctly detects newer versions — previously "1.4.9" was considered newer than "1.4.10" due to string comparison. All users on older versions will now be correctly notified of this and future updates.

---

**v1.4.12 - 2026-05-10**

---

- **Improved**: Battery usage reduced — podcast player polls position less frequently when paused, and the Discover dialog reuses a single HTTP connection pool instead of creating new ones per request.

---


**v1.4.11 - 2026-05-10**

---

- **New Feature**: **YouTube Channel Discovery**. A new "▶ YouTube" tab in Discover shows popular channels by category (🇭🇺 Magyar, News, Tech, Gaming, Finance, and more), updated daily via GitHub Actions. Subscribe with a single tap.
- **Fixed**: HTTP feeds (non-HTTPS) can now be added — the app was silently blocking them on Android 9+.
- **Fixed**: Adding a feed now shows a proper error message if the URL is unreachable or the format is unsupported. Previously it failed silently.
- **Fixed**: Version update check now correctly detects newer versions with double-digit patch numbers (e.g. 1.4.10 > 1.4.9).

---

**v1.4.10 - 2026-05-10**

---

- **Fixed**: Sync no longer spins forever on feeds with many episodes (e.g. 1000+ entries). The automatic full-text fetch during sync has been removed — it was triggering hundreds of HTTP requests per feed.
- **Fixed**: Articles no longer disappear and reappear during pull-to-refresh. Read article visibility is now only reset after a successful sync, not at the start.
- **Fixed**: RSS parser now caps at 100 articles per feed to avoid processing unnecessarily large feeds.
- **Fixed**: HTTP requests now have a 15s connect / 30s read timeout, preventing the sync from hanging indefinitely on slow servers.

---

**v1.4.9 - 2026-05-10**

---

- **Improved**: **RSS Feed Discovery**. The RSS feeds tab in Discover now includes a search powered by the Feedly API — find popular feeds worldwide by keyword, filtered by country/language. The curated list remains as the default view.

---

**v1.4.8 - 2026-05-10**

---

- **Fixed**: CDATA markers (`<![CDATA[...]]>`) no longer appear as visible text at the top of articles. The fix handles all casing variants and works for titles, descriptions, and encoded content fields.

---

**v1.4.7 - 2026-05-10**

---

- **New Feature**: **Built-in Podcast Player**. Podcast episodes now play directly in the app — no external app needed. Includes play/pause, seek bar, –15s / +30s skip, and background playback with lock screen controls.
- **New Feature**: **Podcast Discovery**. Tap "+" → "Discover / Popular" to browse top podcasts by country (🇭🇺 HU, 🇺🇸 US, 🇬🇧 GB, and more) and category (News, Tech, Comedy, Science, Sports, and more) powered by the iTunes Charts. Search by keyword or browse by genre — subscribe with a single tap.
- **New Feature**: **YouTube Link Handling**. Articles containing YouTube links now show a "Watch on YouTube" button. Preferred app (NewPipe, YouTube, or always ask) is configurable in Settings → Media.

---

---

**v1.4.4 - 2026-05-10**

---

- **New Feature**: **YouTube Channel Support**. Add any YouTube channel by pasting its URL (e.g. `youtube.com/@channelname`). Plume automatically resolves it to the channel's RSS feed — no API key needed.
- **New Feature**: **Popular Feeds Browser**. Tap "Popular feeds" in the Add Feed dialog to browse a curated list of popular sources (BBC, Hacker News, The Verge, Reddit, NASA, and more) and add any with a single tap.
